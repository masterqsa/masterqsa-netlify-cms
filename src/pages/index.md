      Oftentimes when working through a ROC, the customer being assessed has
      more than a single payment channel. While completing the assessment for
      each requirement the QSA is required to select a payment channel to
      provide a response for. You may select and provide a response for each
      payment channel, or you may select “All Payment Channel” and provide a
      single response.
